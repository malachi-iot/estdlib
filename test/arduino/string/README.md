# Overview

# 1. Design Goals & Scope

This is a copy of the string example, however it uses a local instead of
pio-referenced version of estdlib, so it may be ahead of the example

Example is useful in particular for Adafruit M0 since it's very hard
to bring it up and see the USB output as resets disconnect the USB.
This test code spits out a new message very second, so that factor
matters less
