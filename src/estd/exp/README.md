# Experimentation area

Not for production use, and much of this area is crusty, old code which never made the grade.

+++ Do not merge back to non `dev/exp` branches! +++

One:

* SHOULD Develop this area on a `dev/exp` branch
* SHOULD NOT merge back to any production-bound branches
* MAY merge between `dev/exp` branches, providing above production-branch rule isn't implicitly broken.
